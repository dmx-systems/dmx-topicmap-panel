# DeepaMehta 5 Topicmap Panel

## Version History

**0.17** -- Oct 21, 2018

* Rename component prop `object-renderers` to `detail-renderers`. It contains both, `object` renderers and `value` renderers.

**0.16** -- Oct 6, 2018

* Component supports manual mounting in conjunction with manual data update ("props" are mirrored as "data")

**0.15** -- Jul 31, 2018

* Component property `selection` is removed.
  Instead the `showTopicmap` action expects a `selection` parameter.
* Change type URI prefixes `dm4` -> `dmx`
* Add GitLab CI/CD

**0.14** -- Jun 20, 2018

* Feature: multi-selection

**0.13** -- Apr 10, 2018

* Feature: show spinner when topicmap/renderer loads
* Fixes:
    * Sync `writable` flag with topicmap renderer
    * Catch "resize" request when no renderer is mounted

**0.12** -- Apr 7, 2018

* Feature: custom topicmap renderers. The host application can provide custom topicmap models (e.g. geomap) and accompanying renderers (e.g. Leaflet based).
    * New component property `topicmapTypes` to inject custom topicmap models and renderers.
    * Dynamic topicmap renderer switching: when the user switches between topicmaps the needed renderer is mounted dynamically.
    * Lazy loading: e.g. the Leaflet package is loaded only in the moment the first geomap is shown.
* The default topicmap renderer is available as standalone component:

**0.11** -- Mar 25, 2018

* Auto-positioning new topic when no position is given
* Fix: pinning types
* Improved composability:
    * New component property `quillConfig` allows the host application to customize the Quill editor in both ways, setting options, and providing extensions (e.g. formats)
    * Emit `child-topic-reveal` event to signalize "user clicked 'Reveal' button in an in-map detail"

**0.10** -- Mar 10, 2018

* Feature: "Pinning". If pinned topic/assoc details remain visible when topic/assoc is not selected.
    * Pinning states are persistent per-topicmap
* Improved composability:
    * New component property `contextCommands` allows the host application to provide the context menu commands
    * Component emits `object-submit` event to signalize "inline edit has completed"
* Detail buttons appear only on mouse hover

**0.9** -- Feb 21, 2018

* In-map *assoc* details
* Improved composability:
    * For configuration the component relies on explicit properties (instead of context injection): `object`, `writable`, `objectRenderers`, `toolbarCompDefs`. Properties have reasonable defaults.
    * Component emits events (instead of dispatching into host app): `topic-select`, `topic-double-click`, `topic-drag`, `topic-drop-on-topic`, `assoc-select`, `topicmap-click`, `topicmap-contextmenu`
    * Toolbar provides separate `left` and `right` mount points
    * Canvas resize can be triggered from outside
* Fixes:
    * Click events on toolbar background bubble to canvas
    * In-map details do not line wrap at canvas edge

**0.8** -- Feb 3, 2018

* In-map topic details with inline edit capability
* "Semantic Fisheye" layout with animations
* Composability: inject context instead of accessing host app's store

**0.7** -- Jan 13, 2018

* Topic colors customizable via CSS vars

**0.6** -- Oct 19, 2017

* Colored associations
* Detect topic double click

**0.5** -- Oct 3, 2017

* Synchronize initialization
* Visualize topic/assoc selection states
