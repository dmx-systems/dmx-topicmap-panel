# DeepaMehta 5 Topicmap Panel

## Version History

**0.9** -- Feb 21, 2018

* In-map *assoc* details.
* Better composability:
    * Component relies on explicit props (instead of context injection): `object`, `writable`, `objectRenderers`, `toolbarCompDefs`. Props have reasonable defaults.
    * Component emits events (instead of dispatching actions): `topic-select`, `topic-double-click`, `topic-drag`, `topic-drop-on-topic`, `assoc-select`, `topicmap-click`, `topicmap-contextmenu`.
    * Toolbar provides separate `left` and `right` mount points.
    * Canvas resize can be triggered from outside.
* Fixes:
    * Click events on toolbar background bubble to canvas.
    * In-map details do not line wrap at canvas edge.
